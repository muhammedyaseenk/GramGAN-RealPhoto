# GramGAN-RealPhoto
Gram-GAN bridges pixel-based and GAN SR methods, generating sharp and realistic textures by explicitly matching generated patches to real HR textures via a Gram-based patch database. It ensures stable training, better generalization, and texture-aware outputsâ€”ideal for satellite, medical, art, and fashion super-resolution tasks.
